# CHANGELOG

This repository contains curated changelogs for closed-source services and software provided by SmartyStreets. For the most part, the file structure herein mirrors that of the [documentation found at smartystreets.com](https://smartystreets.com/docs).

The format of the changelogs is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## Frequency of New Releases

We release new versions of packages whenever new versions are ready, which isn't necessarily on any schedule. For the most part, data packages are released at least once a month, usually as we transition from one calendar month to the next since this matches the release schedule of some of our own upstream data providers (but this isn't universal). We recommend that interested clients/customers subscribe to udpates to this repo. For instance, a scheduled job could pull changes and identify changes to files corresponding to packages of interest. Github also provides an [Atom/RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) feed for all public repos. The feed for this repo can be found at:
